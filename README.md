# Smart-Parking-System
This project demonstrates a Smart Parking System that uses Arduino Uno, IR sensors, a 16x2 LCD (with I2C module), and a servo motor to detect and display the availability of parking slots in real-time. It also controls the parking gate automatically, improving parking management efficiency.
